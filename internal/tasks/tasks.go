// Package tasks is the recent-activity feed behind the dock's Recent Tasks lane:
// the discrete acts every browser should see, not just the one that clicked. It
// holds two lanes in memory only - imperative runtime ops (recorded by the API
// handlers with the caller's identity) and PRs merged into a project's base
// branch (recorded by the forge webhook, re-derived by the refresher's poll).
// Deliberately no persistence: merges reseed from the forge after a restart, and
// the durable audit trail for ops is the cluster's own audit log - every op runs
// under the caller's token. Consumers ride TaskChanged on the bus and re-pull
// out-of-band, like the network catalog.
