// Package eventbus is dotvirt's change-propagation primitive: a typed pub/sub that
// carries both an EDGE (a coalesced wake when a kind moves) and a LEVEL (a monotonic
// per-kind version). Consumers reconcile to the level - they wake on the edge, read
// the current Version of the kinds they depend on, do their work, and re-check the
// Version; if it hasn't moved they're caught up. This is what lets every rebuild
// path stay current without a debounce (coalescing falls out of the work duration)
// or a TTL (invalidation falls out of comparing a version).
//
// A single channel can only notify ONE consumer; the fan-out is what lets the
// exporter, the proposals refresher, and the inventory hub ride the same events.
// Typed kinds keep a consumer from waking on churn it doesn't care about - the
// exporter depends on VMSpecChanged + NamespaceChanged, so a VMI status heartbeat
// (LiveChanged) never wakes it.
